FriCAS
======

FriCAS_ is a computer algebra system (CAS).

For installation instructions see INSTALL.  For general documentation
consult https://fricas.github.io.

The basic goal of FriCAS_ is to create a free advanced world-class
CAS.  In 2007 FriCAS_ forked from Axiom_. Currently FriCAS_ algebra
library is one of the largest and most advanced free general purpose
computer algebra systems -- this gives a good foundation to build
on.  Additionally, FriCAS_ algebra library is written in a high
level strongly typed language (Spad), which allows natural expression
of mathematical algorithms.  This makes FriCAS_ easier to understand
and extend.

Among others FriCAS_ has following functionality:
 - multiple precision arithmetic
 - supports polynomials, rational functions, expressions and series
 - can factor polynomials and compute polynomial gcds
 - calculs functionality like derivatives, integration and limits
 - can solve algebraic and differential equations
 - abstract algebraic structures like groups and rings

FriCAS_ uses lightweight development methodology.  Compared to Axiom_
FriCAS_ is significantly restructured -- it is more portable and fixed
several defects.  FriCAS removed rather large unused parts (without
removing functionality).

Current development goals:

 - continue structural improvements
 - add new mathematical algorithms
 - develop better user interface
 - develop improved Spad compiler
 - make it easier for external programs to interface with FriCAS
 - support for using external mathematical routines from Spad
